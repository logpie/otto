# Otto

Autonomous coding agent that makes Claude safe to run unattended.

Otto wraps Claude Code in a reliability harness: task queue, git isolation, structured QA, and evidence-based verification. You describe what you want, Otto handles the rest.

## How it works

```
otto add "Add search that matches case-insensitively"
otto run
```

For each task, Otto:

1. **Runs a bare CC coding agent** — raw prompt, no spec bottleneck. The coding agent explores the codebase, implements the feature, and runs tests on its own.
2. **Generates acceptance spec in parallel** — `[must]` (gating) and `[should]` (advisory) criteria with `◈` markers for visual/subjective items. Runs in a separate thread alongside coding.
3. **Verifies externally** — runs all tests in a clean disposable worktree.
4. **QA agent reviews** — adversarial testing against spec + original prompt. Risk-based tiering: skip QA when all specs have tests (tier 0), targeted checks (tier 1), or full adversarial testing with browser (tier 2).
5. **Merges** — squash merge to main, clean git history.

Independent tasks within a batch run **in parallel** using git worktrees. Each task gets its own worktree, codes and verifies concurrently, then merges serially. Merge conflicts are auto-retried on updated main.

Failed tasks get structured retry: the coding agent receives a focused failure excerpt (not 847K of raw test output), and pre-existing flaky tests are excluded from retry decisions.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install
uv pip install -e .

# In any git repo — add tasks
cd your-project
otto add "Add a search function that matches case-insensitively"
otto add "Fix the slow API response — must be under 300ms"

# Run
otto run
```

No `otto init` needed — auto-initializes on first `add` or `run`.

## Architecture

### v4.5 pipeline

Otto is infrastructure, not intelligence. The intelligence is Claude's. Otto provides:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Per-task pipeline (runs in parallel worktrees):        │
    │                                                         │
    │  1. Preflight                                           │
    │     Baseline tests (jest + pytest), .gitignore,         │
    │     record flaky test names for later comparison        │
    │                                                         │
    │  2. Coding Agent  ──────────  Spec Gen (parallel)       │
    │     Bare CC, no custom          [must]/[should]/◈       │
    │     system prompt               classification          │
    │                                                         │
    │  3. Pre-verify                                          │
    │     Run tests in working dir. If failures match         │
    │     baseline flaky set → proceed. New failures → retry. │
    │                                                         │
    │  4. External verify (clean disposable worktree)         │
    │     + Claim verification: audit agent log vs evidence   │
    │                                                         │
    │  5. QA Agent (adversarial, risk-tiered)                 │
    │     Tier 0: skip │ Tier 1: targeted │ Tier 2: browser   │
    │     Writes per-item proof + screenshots to qa-proofs/   │
    │                                                         │
    │  6. Post-QA restore (reset to verified candidate SHA)   │
    │     Task state: verified                                │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │  Serial merge phase (after all parallel tasks finish):  │
    │                                                         │
    │  7. Merge each verified task onto main (in order)       │
    │     Post-merge test verification per task               │
    │     Conflict → auto-retry task on updated main          │
    │                                                         │
    │  8. Pass → merge + proof report with commit SHA         │
    │     Fail → retry with failure excerpt (not raw output)  │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Parallel batch execution

Independent tasks within a batch run concurrently in git worktrees:

```
Batch 1: [task A, task B, task C]  ← independent → run in PARALLEL
          ↓ all verified, then merge serially
Batch 2: [task D]                  ← depends on A+B → runs AFTER batch 1
```

- **Within-batch** = parallel (tasks are independent, each in its own worktree)
- **Cross-batch** = serial (later batches depend on earlier results)
- **Merge phase** = serial (verified tasks merge one-by-one onto main)
- **Conflict auto-retry** = merge-failed tasks re-run on updated main

Task states: `pending → running → verified → merge_pending → passed`
(or `→ failed` / `→ merge_failed` on errors)

### Spec binding model

Each spec item has a binding level and verifiability marker:

- **`[must]`** — gating. QA blocks merge if failed.
- **`[must ◈]`** — gating + visual/subjective. Requires browser verification.
- **`[should]`** — advisory. QA notes observations but doesn't block.
- **`[should ◈]`** — advisory + visual. Noted with evidence.

### QA verdict

QA produces structured JSON with per-item evidence and proof:

```json
{
  "must_passed": true,
  "must_items": [
    {
      "spec_id": 1,
      "criterion": "Banner appears when wind > 60 km/h",
      "status": "pass",
      "evidence": "detectSeverityConditions checks all 4 thresholds",
      "proof": [
        "ran jest weatherAlerts: 'detects wind > 60 km/h' passes",
        "browser: banner visible after injecting extreme data",
        "screenshot: qa-proofs/screenshot-banner.png"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Proof of work

Each task produces reproducible evidence in `otto_logs/<key>/qa-proofs/`:

```
qa-proofs/
  proof-report.md          Human-readable proof per must item
  regression-check.sh      Re-runnable verification commands
  must-1.md ... must-N.md  Per-item criterion + status + evidence
  screenshot-*.png         Browser screenshots (visual ◈ items)
```

The **proof report** shows per-item proof with coverage:

```markdown
## ✓ [1] Banner appears when wind > 60 km/h
Evidence: detectSeverityConditions checks all 4 thresholds
Proof:
- ran jest weatherAlerts: 'detects wind > 60 km/h' passes
- browser: banner visible after injecting extreme data
- screenshot-banner.png — Red banner at top with all conditions

---
Proof coverage: 6/6 must items have proof recorded
```

The **regression script** is independently runnable ground truth — a third party can re-run it without trusting the agent:

```bash
bash otto_logs/<key>/qa-proofs/regression-check.sh
# → Test Suites: 43 passed, Tests: 997 passed
```

### Display

Semantic color hierarchy for scannability:

- **Green `● Write`/`● Edit`** — code changes (key actions)
- **Cyan `● Bash`** — commands
- **Dim `● Read`** — background exploration
- **Cyan `[must]`** — gating requirements
- **Magenta `◈`** — visual/subjective marker
- **Bold `Testing:`/`Curl:`** — QA verification actions
- **Bold magenta `Browser:`** — visual testing

## Configuration

`otto.yaml` (auto-created):

```yaml
max_retries: 3
default_branch: main
verify_timeout: 300       # seconds for test suite
max_task_time: 3600       # 1hr circuit breaker per task
qa_timeout: 3600          # QA agent timeout
max_parallel: 1           # 1 = serial (default), 2+ = parallel worktrees
install_timeout: 120      # seconds for npm ci / pip install in worktrees

# Per-agent setting scopes (comma-separated: user, project)
coding_agent_settings: "user,project"   # reads user + project CLAUDE.md
spec_agent_settings: "project"          # project CLAUDE.md only
qa_agent_settings: "project"            # project CLAUDE.md only
```

Auto-detected: test_command, default_branch. Override anything in `otto.yaml`.

### Parallel execution

Set `max_parallel: 2` (or higher) to run independent tasks concurrently. Each task gets its own git worktree at `.otto-worktrees/otto-task-<key>/`. Worktrees are cleaned up after each run. Serial is the default — parallel is opt-in.
